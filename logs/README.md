# Security Logs Directory

This directory contains security event logs generated by the application.

## Files

- `security.log` - JSON-formatted security events (login attempts, rate limits, etc.)

## Log Rotation

In production, configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues:

```bash
# Example logrotate configuration
/app/logs/security.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 www-data www-data
}
```

## Security Notes

- Do not commit actual log files to version control
- Ensure logs are readable only by application user
- Review logs regularly for suspicious activity
